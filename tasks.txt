- tweens
	- need to figure out a consistent usage for these so they are super easy to use

- layer bit fields
	- build a static class that can be used to generate the layer bit flags automatically so you don't have to fuss with it every time
	- collision_layer = engine->collision_flags::get_next_bit(); or something

- move_player
	- this all needs to be abstracted in some nice way - or does it?

- sticky camera
	- camera moves with the player

arg: start_pos, end_pos, time_ms
	// time_ms is how long it takes to move from start->end

take how long
choose how far the platform moves each second
