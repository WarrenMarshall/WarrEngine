- "gradient"
	- change the color list to take a repeat count after each color
		- so from "color.black / color.white / color.black"
		  to "color.black:1 / color.white:6 / color.black:1"

- deleting entities is broken, i think
	- make sure you can delete them cleanly
	- test with balls hitting the death zone

--LIFE--


- get pre/post update calls working
- once "ending_pos" is computed, change collisions to use capsules
- see if we can smooth out that bump that happens at slow update rates
- start thinking about what's next - collision masks and what-not
