- EC_SPRITE creation with bad subtex name should crash immediately

- "log_msg( fmt::format("
	- can this used std::forward or something to shorten to : "log_msg("

- emitter defs
	- "texture_name" "tex_particle_star"
		- this should become a "subtexture_name" for consistency

- new emitters
	- ball has fireball effect
		- trailing fire particles
	- power up grabbed
		- spray of stars
	- ball hit the death zone
		- smoke fizzle

- "gradient"
	- change the color list to take a repeat count after each color
		- so from "color.black / color.white / color.black"
		  to "color.black:1 / color.white:6 / color.black:1"

i like the idea of a vfx group of entity components that can wrangle a bunch of entity_components.

	ec_vfx_group
		- w_timer to track how long to turn it on for
		- children
			- ec_emitter
			- ec_sound
			- ec_???

when you need the vfx group, set the timer to tell it how long to turn it's children on for. when the timer runs out, they all go to sleep.
